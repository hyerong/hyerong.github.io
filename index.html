	<h1>HYEJA JUNG DESIGN</h1>
	<P>As reflected in my resume, I have had 12 years of varied professional design and advertising experience as an art director and senior graphic designer at Oricom Advertising Agency in Seoul, Korea.

I worked for many international and domestic clients such as Budweiser, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Little Caesars Pizza, Ray Ban Sunglasses, IBM, Kimberly-Clark, Printemps Department store, Korean Airlines, Oriental Brewery Co., LTD., Basso Apparel, Doosan Conglomerate, Telson Electronics, Maell Dairy, Doosan Sigram and many others.</P>
